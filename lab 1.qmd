## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
```

```{r}
glimpse(midwest)
```

```{r}
view(midwest)
```

1.  Making a histogram to visualize the population density of counties

```{r}
ggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000, fill = "light blue")+
labs(title = "population density in different counties", x = "population density", y = "frequency")
```

The distribution has a right skewed tail.

There seems to be a few counties with an extremely high population density at around 60000 and 90000. These are outliers, they are far away from most of the data and outside of the curve.
